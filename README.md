# FAQ
## How do you spell Gregoriose? I have seen the spelling Gregorios used frequently.
The correct spelling is Gregoriose. That is what is used by all the assets in this repository as of October 2015.

## What software should I use to edit the graphics
Use Adobe Illustrator. This way you will always get vector images that can be scaled to any size - from postage stamp size to banner size.

## What will I do if I don't have fonts used by the logo
You can download them from this repo and install them. They are placed in the "Fonts used by logo" directory.

## Illustrator shows me an error when I open a file. What should I do?
If the error is "Illustrator now honors 9-slice scaling of symbols. Any scaling done on symbol instances with 9-slice scaling option in legacy version will look different now. Do you want to retain the 9-slice scaling option for symbols? - No or Yes"
Choose "No"
