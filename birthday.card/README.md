# How to order new birthday cards.

You need to order the card and the envelope to put the card in. The card when folded will measure 5" by 7". The adobe illustrator images you provide will be for the unfolded card. So it will be 10" by 7". There will be two sides, the outside and the inside. So you will provide two images of 10" by 7" each.

The envelope that accepts the 5x7 card is 5.25" by 7.25".

So we have to submit two images for the card, and one for the envelope. The card images are called "birthday.card.inside.ai" and "birthday.card.outside.ai". The envelope image is called "birthday.card.envelope.ai"
