# Editing the logo

You won't have to edit the logo. It is pretty neat already. But if you feel like editing it, do it in adobe illustrator.

# Fonts

When you try to open it, if you find that AI is complaining about fonts, install the missing fonts. They are found in this same repo in the '/fonts used by logo' folder. (Just select them all and double click.)

# Saving
After you have edited the image, save it to two formats: jpeg and png.
